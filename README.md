# MemoryGame

This is a Web Application Game built with Vanilla Js and CSS. I Also used Illustrator to create the cards and images used in the game. 

## Motivation
I decide to build a Memory Game to practice JS and CSS. 
And I used as reference a tutorial from FreeCodeCamp to make a better use of my time and improve the learning process.
